### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The following statistical data includes 2023 data and my personal projects.  
Also, top languages does not indicate my skill level or anything like that. It is just a metric of which languages have been hosted by me on GitHub based on the usage across repositories. There are others which I haven't put up on GitHub.
