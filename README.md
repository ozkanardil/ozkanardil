### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

The following statistical data includes 2023 data and my personal projects.  
Also, top languages does not indicate my skill level or anything like that. It is just a metric of which languages have been hosted by me on GitHub based on the usage across repositories. There are others which I haven't put up on GitHub.

:telescope: Iâ€™m working as a Software Developer and contributing to frontend and backend for building web applications.

:seedling: Exploring Technical Content Writing.

:zap: In my free time, I work on my start-up project.
